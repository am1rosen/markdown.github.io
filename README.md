## Introduction
In electronic circuits, biasing refers to the process of applying direct current (DC) voltages and currents to a device in order to set it at a specific working condition. This setup determines how much current flows and what voltage levels are present when there is no input signal. In the case of transistor amplifiers, the applied DC bias establishes a specific operating point on the device’s characteristic curves. This point defines the region of operation where the transistor will function properly for amplifying signals.

The operating point is also called the quiescent point (Q-point), which comes from the word quiescent, meaning still or inactive. It represents the steady-state condition of the circuit when no input signal is applied. Figure 4.1 (below) illustrates a general device characteristic showing different possible operating points.
